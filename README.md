#RecipeFinder

RecipeFinder was done by Noor Alhoussari and Varninder Rai on 26th of June 2017 for one week.

With RecipeFinder, you can find recipes based on ingredients you have in your fridge. 
You can filter your recipes by nutrition values (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, grain-free and dairy-free)

Smart search: the recipes will still be generated regardless of miss-spelling or leaving a blank field.

Features added: a spinner was added to the tableView, while waiting for the recipes data to be listed.

The API used in this app, generate more that 350,000 recipes

Collaboration between Objective-c and swift. Objective-c is the main language in this project.

Features to be added: save "My favourite Recipes‚Äù
