RecipeFinder

RecipeFinder was done by Noor Alhoussari and Varninder Rai on 26th of June 2017

With RecipeFinder, you can find recipes based on ingredients you have in your fridge. 
You can filter your recipes by nutrition values (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, grain-free and dairy-free)

Smart search: the recipes will still be generated regardless of miss-spelling or leaving a blank field.

Features added: a spinner while waiting for the recipes data to be listed.

The API used in this app, generate more that 350,000 recipes
(The chargeable API was unsubscribed for this App till it's finalized and/or to be added to the app store)

Collaboration between Objective-c and swift. Objective-c is the main language in this project.

Features to be added: save "My favourite Recipes”
